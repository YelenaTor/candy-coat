# Contributing to Candy Coat

Thank you for your interest in Candy Coat.

## This project is not open to external contributions.

Candy Coat is proprietary software developed exclusively for Sugar Venue. The codebase is managed internally by the venue's technical team to ensure consistency, security, and alignment with operational requirements.

Pull requests, forks, and unsolicited patches will not be reviewed or merged.

## Reporting Issues

If you are a Sugar Venue staff member and encounter a bug or have a feature request:

- Contact the development lead directly via the venue Discord
- Include steps to reproduce the issue, your character name, and the plugin version (visible in Settings)
- Crash logs can be found in `%APPDATA%\XIVLauncher\dalamud.log`

## Future Plans

Candy Coat will be rebranded as **Backstage** for public release. At that point, contributions will be welcomed under a new open-source license and contribution guidelines will be published. Until then, this repository remains closed.
